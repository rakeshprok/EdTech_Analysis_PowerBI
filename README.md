# 🎓 EdTech Courses Analysis – Power BI Project  

## Introduction  
The EdTech industry is growing faster than ever, with thousands of online courses competing for learners’ attention. For a platform, it’s not enough to just host courses — you need to know **which courses resonate, what skills are in demand, and how factors like language or duration affect enrollments**.  

In this project, I took on the role of a data analyst at an EdTech company. My goal was simple but powerful:  

<ul>
  <li>Identify which courses and formats drive the most engagement.</li>
  <li>Understand whether subtitles, duration, and language really influence learner decisions.</li>
  <li>Highlight top skills and instructors that deserve investment.</li>
</ul>  

To do this, I built an <b>interactive Power BI dashboard</b> from a raw dataset containing thousands of online courses across platforms like Coursera, FutureLearn, and Simplilearn. The end result wasn’t just a dashboard — it was a decision-making tool.

## Data Journey  

### 1. Understanding & Cleaning the Data  
I started in <b>Power Query</b>, where I profiled the dataset and ensured quality:  

<ul>
  <li>Removed duplicates, blanks, and error rows.</li>
  <li>Dropped completely empty columns.</li>
  <li>Converted text-based ratings like <i>“4.8 stars”</i> into numeric values.</li>
  <li>Standardized course durations, which were written in mixed formats (hours, weeks, months).</li>
</ul>  

This step was critical — clean, consistent data builds the foundation for any trustworthy insight.  

### 2. Framing the Right Business Questions  
Instead of just looking at columns, I asked myself: <i>How can these fields answer real business questions?</i>  

<ul>
  <li><b>Category/Sub-Category</b> → Which subjects attract the most learners?</li>
  <li><b>Course Type</b> → Do learners prefer certifications, projects, or full specializations?</li>
  <li><b>Languages & Subtitles</b> → Does accessibility improve reach and engagement?</li>
  <li><b>Skills & Instructors</b> → Where should the company invest for the highest learner impact?</li>
</ul>  

By framing data this way, I turned attributes into <b>business levers</b> that a product or strategy team would care about.

## Dashboard Highlights  

<ul>
  <li><b>Category & Course Type Analysis</b> → Showed which categories lean heavily toward specific course types, guiding product launches.</li>
  <li><b>Average Views (Category → Sub-Category → Language)</b> → Revealed engagement shifts as we drilled deeper, helping marketing teams localize campaigns.</li>
  <li><b>Language Distribution</b> → Identified which languages dominate the platform, valuable for global expansion.</li>
  <li><b>Skills Word Cloud</b> → Highlighted trending skills, so course development could align with real market demand.</li>
  <li><b>Top Instructors (Top 3 by Rating)</b> → Spotlighted high-performing educators worth promoting or partnering with.</li>
  <li><b>Duration vs. Engagement</b> → Tested whether course length impacts enrollments, informing instructional design.</li>
  <li><b>Subtitles Impact</b> → Explored if multilingual subtitles correlated with higher purchases — a direct link between accessibility and revenue.</li>
</ul>  

Each of these visuals answered a <i>“so what?”</i> question — not just displaying numbers, but shaping <b>strategic decisions</b>.

## Business Impact  

This dashboard goes beyond pretty visuals. It’s a <b>decision-support tool</b>:  

<ul>
  <li><b>Product Managers</b> can see what formats and categories drive demand, and prioritize new launches accordingly.</li>
  <li><b>Marketing Teams</b> can refine targeting strategies by language and learner behavior.</li>
  <li><b>Content Strategists</b> can double down on trending skills and successful instructors.</li>
  <li><b>Operations</b> can measure the ROI of subtitles and accessibility investments.</li>
</ul>  

In short, it turns raw course data into <b>clear, actionable strategy</b> — helping optimize portfolios, grow engagement, and improve returns.

## Conclusion  

The <b>EdTech Courses Analysis</b> project reinforced something I believe strongly:  
A data analyst’s job isn’t just to build dashboards — it’s to <b>tell a story that moves the business forward</b>.  

By combining technical expertise with business understanding, I turned scattered course records into insights that guide product launches, marketing campaigns, and learner success.
